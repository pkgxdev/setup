      Whitespace separated, pkgs to supplement the environment. eg.

      ```yaml
      +: |
        deno.land^1.30
        rust-lang.org^1.60
      ```

      By default tea reads your developer environment and adds those packages.
      Specifying additional packages here is a way to augment that.
    required: false
  srcroot:
    description: |
      Override detection of `$SRCROOT`.

      tea normally finds your `$SRCROOT` by looking for a `.git` directory.
      However, if git is not installed the checkout action uses the GitHub
      API to download the repository.

      You will need this if you depend on the virtual environment tea
      provides.
