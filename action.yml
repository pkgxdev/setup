      Override detection of `$SRCROOT`.

      tea normally finds your `$SRCROOT` by looking for a `.git` directory.
      However, if git is not installed the checkout action uses the GitHub
      API to download the repository.

      You will need this if you depend on the virtual environment tea
      provides.
